\description{
This internal function establishes a connection to a DuckDB database. It can handle both a character file name 
or an object of class `ch3_db` to open the database.
}
\details{
This function checks the class of `ch3_db` and attempts to connect to the database. If `ch3_db` is a character string, 
it will create an object of class `ch3_db`. If `ch3_db` is already of class `ch3_db`, it will directly establish a 
connection to the database.
}
\note{
This function is intended for internal use within the package.
