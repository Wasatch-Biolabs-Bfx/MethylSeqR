\title{Plot Case vs Control Methylation Fractions with Density-Weighted Points}
\usage{
plot_ch3_diff_density(
  ch3_db,
  table,
  thresh = c(0.2, 0.3),
  palette = "turbo",
  size = 0.8
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ch3_db}{A path to the CH3 SQLite database, or an open database connection object.}

\item{table}{A string specifying the table name within the database, containing `mh_frac_case` and `mh_frac_control` columns.}

\item{thresh}{A numeric vector of length 1 or 2 giving the positive and negative threshold values to draw as dashed red lines above and below the identity line (default is `c(0.2, 0.3)`). If `NULL`, no threshold lines are drawn.}

\item{palette}{A string specifying the viridis color palette for density shading (default is `"turbo"`). Other options include `"viridis"`, `"plasma"`, `"cividis"`, etc.}

\item{size}{A numeric value controlling point size in the plot (default is `0.8`).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the closed database connection object. The plot is printed to the current graphics device.

\description{
This function generates a scatter plot of methylation fractions in case vs control samples
from a CH3 SQLite database table, with optional density shading and threshold lines.
}
\details{
This function visualizes the relationship between `mh_frac_case` and `mh_frac_control` methylation values
by plotting them on a scatter plot. It optionally enhances visualization with local point density using
the `ggpointdensity` package if available.

Features:
\itemize{
  \item If \strong{ggpointdensity} is installed, point density is used to color points.
  \item If not installed, a fallback to plain transparent points is used.
  \item A solid black identity line (`y = x`) is added for reference.
  \item Optional threshold lines at Â±`thresh` distance from the identity line are shown as red dashed lines.
}

The plot is limited to the [0, 1] range for both axes and uses a clean classic theme.
