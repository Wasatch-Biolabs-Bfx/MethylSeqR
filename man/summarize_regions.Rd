\title{Summarize Methylation Data by Regions}
\usage{
summarize_regions(
  ch3_db,
  region_file,
  chrom = c(paste0("chr", 1:22), "chrX", "chrY", "chrM"),
  join_type = "inner",
  min_cov = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ch3_db}{A list containing the database file path. This should be a valid "ch3_db" class object.}

\item{region_file}{A string representing the path to the BED or CSV file that contains the region annotations.}

\item{join_type}{A string indicating the type of join to perform. Options are "inner", "left", 
"right", or "full". Default is "inner".}
}
\value{
The updated `ch3_db` object with the summarized regions data added to the DuckDB database.
}
\description{
This function summarizes methylation data from a DuckDB database based on specified regions 
defined in a BED, TSV, or CSV file. It performs a join operation between the methylation data and 
the regions specified in the annotation file, allowing for different types of joins.
}
\details{
The function reads the region annotations from the regional annotation file and checks for its validity.
It connects to the DuckDB database, creates a summarized table of methylation data based on the specified 
regions, and performs the join operation according to the specified join type. A progress bar is displayed 
during the summarization process. The resulting data is stored in a table called "regions" within the database.
}
\examples{
 # Specify the path to the database
 ch3_db <- system.file("my_data.ch3.db", package = "MethylSeqR")
 
 region_bed = system.file("Islands_hg38_test.csv", package = "MethylSeqR")
 # Summarize Regions using annotation table
 summarize_regions(ch3_db, region_bed)

}
