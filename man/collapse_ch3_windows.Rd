\usage{
collapse_ch3_windows(
  ch3_db,
  max_distance = 1000,
  sig_cutoff = 0.05,
  min_diff = 0.5,
  output_table_name = "collapsed_windows"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ch3_db}{A DuckDB database connection object or path to the database.}

\item{max_distance}{Numeric. The maximum allowable distance between consecutive
significant windows for merging (default: 1000).}

\item{sig_cutoff}{Numeric. The significance threshold for adjusted p-values
(default: 0.05).}

\item{min_diff}{Numeric. The minimum absolute methylation difference required
for inclusion in the analysis (default: 0.5).}

\item{output_table_name}{Character. Name of the output table to store collapsed
windows (default: "collapsed_windows").}
}
\value{
This function does not return an object; it creates or replaces the
        `collapsed_windows` table in the database.
}
\description{
This function collapses significant windows in a methylation dataset by merging
contiguous regions that meet the specified criteria. Can only collapse windows 
once a differential modification analysis (calc_ch3_diff()) has been called.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\itemize{
  \item Filters the `mod_diff_windows` to retain only significant windows where
        `p_adjust <= sig_cutoff` and `ABS(meth_diff) >= min_diff`.
  \item Assigns a new region identifier based on proximity (`max_distance`) and
        the direction of methylation differences.
  \item Collapses regions by grouping contiguous windows, computing the
        average methylation difference (`avg_meth_diff`), and counting the
        number of merged windows.
